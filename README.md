# powershell-scripts
A small collection of scripts made for different tasks.

* Set_powersettings.ps - Script to change power-settings to High Performance on Windows 7 - 10
* desktop_shortcuts.ps1 - Script to create a bunch of desktop / start-menu shortcut's to webpages on Windows 10 (Intune / SCCM)


All scripts are created fast and dirty (sloppyness and bad error handling exists)
